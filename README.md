# Overview
Ros package to control force feedback of logitech g29 steering wheel from ros message, written in c++, for human beings all over the world.
This is useful for the user interface of autonomous driving, driving simulator like [CARLA](https://carla.org/), [LGSVL](https://www.lgsvlsimulator.com/) etc.

# Features
* Standalone ros package to control steering wheel. (doesn't depend on the other ros packages like ros-melodic-joy etc.)

* We can control angle of logitech g29 steering wheel with throwing ros message.

* Two control modes
    1. Control mode  
        Rotate wheel to the specified angle. This mode can rotate wheel to the specified angle and torque with your hands off, so this mode is useful for the user interface of autonomous driving system.

    2. Auto centering mode  
        This mode make it easier to control vehicle manually in the driving simulator. Centering torque can be specified with parameters.

# Demo

# Requirement
* ubuntu
* ros melodic
* Logitech G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel (Planning to test with g923)

To check whether your kernel supports force feedback, do as follows
```bash
$ cat /boot/config-5.3.0-46-generic | grep CONFIG_LOGIWHEELS_FF
CONFIG_LOGIWHEELS_FF=y
```  
If you cannot get `CONFIG_LOGIWHEELS_FF=y`, try to find patch or use latest kernel...

# Install
1. create catkin_ws
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/any/dir
    mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
    cd /catkin_ws
    catkin_make
    ```
1. download and build package
    ```bash
    cd /catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/kuriatsu/ros-g29-force-feedback.git -b ros1
    cd ../
    catkin_make
    ```

# Usage
1. confirm your device name
    ```bash
    $ cat /proc/bus/input/devices
    ```
    find **Logitech G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel** and check Handlers (ex. event19)

1. change parameters in **g29_force_feedback.yaml**
    |parameter|default|description|
    |:--|:--|:--|
    |device_name|/dev/input/event19|device name, change the number|
    |loop_rate|0.1|Loop of retrieving wheel position and uploading control to the wheel|
    |max_torque|1.0|As for g29, 1.0 = 2.5Nm (min_torque < max_torque < 1.0)|
    |min_torque|0.2|Less than 0.2 cannot rotate wheel|
    |brake_torque|0.2|Braking torque to stop at the position (descrived below)|
    |brake_position|0.1|Braking position(descrived below)|
    |auto_centering_max_torque|0.3|Max torque for auto centering|
    |auto_centering_max_position|0.2|Max torque position while auto centering|
    |eps|0.01|Wheel in the range (from position-eps to position+eps) is considered as it has reached the specified position|
    |auto_centering|false|Anto centering if true|

1. run ros node
    ```bash
    $ source /path/to/catkin_ws/install/setup.bash
    $ cd /path/to/catkin_ws
    $ rosrun ros_g29_force_feedback  g29_force_feedback_node --ros-args --params-file /path/to/catkin_ws/install/ros_g29_force_feedback/share/ros_g29_force_feedback/config/g29.yaml
    ```

1. Throw message (It's better to use tab completion)  
    ```bash
    $ rostopic pub /ff_target ros_g29_force_feedback/msg/ForceFeedback "{header: {stamp: {sec: 0, nanosec: 0}, frame_id: ''}, position: 0.0, torque: 0.1}"
    ```
    Once the message is thrown, the wheel rotates to 0.3*<max_angle> (as for g29 ±450°).
    Publish rate is not restricted.

# Change Log

## 2020-10-10
### changed
PID-Constant mode can be changed dynamically!!
Removed mode selection from rosparam.
Rotation force is ignored when PID mode. (max force can be specified with rosparam (not dynamic))

## 2021-11-03
### Huge Improvement !!!
Oscillation problem solved.
Wheel stops at the specified position, then starts auto centering.
Auto centering mode are set by rosparam in config/g29.yaml, not by rostopic.
Name of topic variables changed.
